Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications that has revolutionized how we build modern web applications. In this post, I'll share my experience working with Next.js and explore its key features that make it stand out.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js solves many common challenges in web development by providing an intuitive and powerful framework. Here are some compelling reasons to choose Next.js:

### Performance First

Next.js is built with performance in mind. Its automatic code splitting, image optimization, and smart bundling ensure your application loads quickly and efficiently.

### Developer Experience

The developer experience is exceptional with features like:
- Fast Refresh for instant feedback
- Intuitive file-based routing
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Excellent documentation and community

### Flexibility

Next.js offers multiple rendering options:
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Client-side rendering when needed

## Key Features

Here are some standout features that make Next.js my go-to framework:

- **Server-side rendering**: Improves SEO and initial page load
- **File-based routing**: Simplifies navigation structure
- **API routes**: Backend endpoints without separate server
- **Built-in optimizations**: Automatic image and font optimization

## Code Example

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```
