I made this for my chemical segment studies at school. I made both a [website](https://element-catalogue.vercel.app/) and a [macOS app](https://github.com/omeriadon/ElementCatalogue).

Just like for MultiClip, I had to use some AppKit capabilities to make it floating and pinned to the top.

After that I inserted a Periodic table from [Browsinator](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON/blob/master/PeriodicTableJSON.json) on GitHub.

The list was easy to make after and I added bookmarking via SwiftData after.

The React page was simple too.
